I'm currently a Masters Student at the :school:[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany who is passionate about building software to improve community. In particular, I love working on Neural Networks involving large datasets and their application in Computer Vision. I firmly believe that, a man becomes what he :apple: eats and :tophat: thinks. I try to maintain a healthy diet with regular exercises to keep myself fit. Apart from coding stuff, I love playing :tennis: Badminton and  enjoy :running: running.  Recently, I completed my A1 level of Deutsch with [TUM Sprachenzentrum](https://www.sprachenzentrum.tum.de/startseite/).

This summer, I was a part of Lecture electives offered at TUM by

:corn: [ Dynamic Vision and Learning Lab ](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/) on Introduction to Deep Learning [(I2DL)](https://dvl.in.tum.de/teaching/i2dl-ss20/).

:corn: [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.in.tum.de/) on Multiple View Geometry  [(MVG)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDkwklFGMfo&list=PLTBdjV_4f-EJn6udZ34tht9EVIW7lbeo4).

:corn: My practical implementations can be found [here](https://github.com/kamranisg/CV2-Multiple-View-Geometry).
